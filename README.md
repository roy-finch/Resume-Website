## My Resume Website
This is the README.md file for my resume website. I am creating this website for my User Centric Unit of my code institute course.
Within this course I am going to create a website which will present a website which has general functionality and accessiblity across different browsers and devices.
This website will be a personal resume and will contain information about what I would include for a my own resume.
This README.md file will contain the information about the developement of the website over time.

## Introduction
I am going to create a website that will encapsulate and present the idea of my choice. I am chosing to create a resume website.
In this website I will focus on producing a very simple, factual and functional page.
This page should contain information that an actual employer would require to understand who I am and my experience.
This website must be highly function and be able to be accessed by many different browsers and devices, and must smoothly change between the different screen sizes.
It must contain alterations that have been made to allow for the website to be easier to use in mobile or tablet devices.
Such as alterations to the navigation bar or general structure alterations to reduce excessive use of the webpage or screen display.
These alternations would generally output seperate layouts and displays on different devices but will continue to output the same information.
<br>

Whenever I create a webpage I focus on the functionality of the website and the navigation system that are inplace.
Once the webpage and a navigation bar has been created I would then begin to set the information into a layout suitable for the purpose and functionality of the page.

## Initial idea
I would like to create the beginning section of code using the Emmit function.
Once thats created I will start by stating the initial declarations for where external style will be placed.
I like to create the beginning page and spend time trying to find the style and layout that I am looking for.
<br>

Start by creating a navigation bar, I would like for the navigation bar to be able to be toggled open/closed using an icon.
I would also like to be able to make sure that its easy to navigate between pages and be able to offer the same level of accessibility to any type of users.
I would like to make sure that on a mobile or tablet version of the website the page is in full display and the navigation bar doesn't interfere with the user of the page.
<br>

I need to have suitable names for each of the different pages, I would like to make the website one who document, which has navigation links which would move the user down the page to the different sections of the page.
Also I would like to make the navigation bar fixed at the top of the screen so that navigation tabs can be accessed thoughout the use of the webpage.
<br>

The different webpage can be named,
<li>Home / Overview</li>
<li>About Me</li>
<li>Experience</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Contact</li>

Any of the webpages that have been chosen may be altered later on in development so that I can make the webpage more functional.
I apply a simple style at first so that it is easier to position and place the different links around the page, where I would like to place them.
