## My Resume Website
This is the README.md file for my resume website. I am creating this website for my User Centric Unit of my code institute course.
Within this course I am going to create a website which will present a website which has general functionality and accessiblity across different browsers and devices.
This website will be a personal resume and will contain information about what I would include for a my own resume.

## Introduction
I am going to create a website that will encapsulate and present the idea of my choice. I am chosing to create a resume website.
In this website I will focus on producing a very simple, factual and functional page.
This page should contain information that an actual employer would require to understand who I am and my experience.
This website must be highly function and be able to be accessed by many different browsers and devices, and must smoothly change between the different screen sizes.
It must contain alterations that have been made to allow for the website to be easier to use in mobile or tablet devices.
Such as alterations to the navigation bar or general structure alterations to reduce excessive use of the webpage or screen display.
These alternations would generally output seperate layouts and displays on different devices but will continue to output the same information.

Whenever I create a webpage I focus on the functionality of the website and the navigation system that are inplace.
Once the webpage and a navigation bar has been created I would then begin to set the information into a layout suitable for the purpose and functionality of the page.
